	<p>A team of scientists has developed an advanced artificial intelligence system capable of predicting natural disasters with an accuracy rate of 90%. This AI model analyzes vast amounts of data from various sources, including satellite imagery and historical records, to identify patterns and anomalies that precede disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods.
	The ability to provide early warnings with such precision could revolutionize disaster preparedness and response, potentially saving thousands of lives and reducing economic losses. The technology is currently undergoing field testing, with plans to deploy it in high-risk areas around the world.</p>
